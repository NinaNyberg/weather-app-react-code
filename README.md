# Weather app with React

- current location weather
- selected location weather
- autocomplete search for locations (GeoDB and openweathermap)
- 3-day weather forecast
- animated background for temperatures lower and higther than 20Â°C (colder and warmer colors)
- responsive
- cypress tests (only for version without autocomplete for now, so they are commented out for the time being)
